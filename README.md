# MediaBrowser.IsoMounting.Linux
This implements two core interfaces, IIsoManager, and IIsoMount.
### IIsoManager
The manager class can be used to create a mount, and also determine if the mounter is capable of mounting a given file.
### IIsoMount
IIsoMount then represents a mount instance, which will be unmounted on disposal.
